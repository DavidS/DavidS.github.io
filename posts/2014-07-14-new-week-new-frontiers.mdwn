# munin and testing

Updating a [semi-random module](https://github.com/DavidS/puppet-munin) to use
the latest and greates testing technology from [Puppet
Labs](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache).

As you can see on [the PR](https://github.com/example42/puppet-munin/pull/19),
there was some fun to be had.
