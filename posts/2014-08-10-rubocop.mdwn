# rubocop

Furthering my quest for rails best practices I've added
[rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) to my arsenal. There were some
[changes](https://github.com/DavidS/hrdb/commit/0cb32c4939de3b39fd0b958f35e3140de9f23484)
but nothing really objectionable. Some parts felt a bit nit-picky, like
requiring single quotes when no interpolation happens, but all-in-all I believe
it's a net plus. I'll have to gain some more experience when starting the meat
of the code.

# codeclimate

I also [extracted
more](https://github.com/DavidS/hrdb/commit/c100b36b7a72287c0e67074a89495d476b05a1f8)
code into concerns and [cleaned up the
default\_responses](https://github.com/DavidS/hrdb/commit/4e2d0bf9af37dc2353132638fa471ec91a234f35)
concern. So now codeclimate is happy again. The actual default responses are so
small now, that I consider inlining them again. That will probably become more
pertinent as soon as save/update need to do more than send the model to the
database. Again, something that needs more experience with actual use cases.
