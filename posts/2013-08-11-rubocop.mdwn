# rubocop

Furthering my quest for rails best practices I've added
[rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) to my arsenal. There were some
[changes](https://github.com/DavidS/hrdb/commit/0cb32c4939de3b39fd0b958f35e3140de9f23484)
but nothing really objectionable. Some parts felt a bit nit-picky, like
requiring single quotes when no interpolation happens, but all-in-all I believe
it's a net plus. I'll have to gain some more experience when starting the meat
of the code.
