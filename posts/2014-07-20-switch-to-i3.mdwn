Besides a little
[work](http://tasks.hotosm.org/user/David%20&%20Christine%20Schmitt) on
[HOT](http://www.hotosm.org/), today I switched to [i3](http://i3wm.org/). I
added a shortcut to cater to my GNOME and Windows muscle memory. Now
Ctrl+Shift+(up|down) changes workspaces, Win+L locks the screen (directly to
DPMS off), and Win+R (instead of Win+D) opens a single-shot command line.

I really dig that i3 arranges windows neatly tiled. It's how I'd arrange them
manually (or used an extension the last few weeks in GNOME). Only much less
hassle, because i3 does it automatically. And is much more flexible than the
bugger extension I used in GNOME.

Also, now I have a simple plcae to start my commonly running programs on login
without having to click the clicks.

On the downside, ssh key unlocking still needs some work.
