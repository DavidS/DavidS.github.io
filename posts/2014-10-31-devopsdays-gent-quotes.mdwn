[[!meta title="devopsdays Gent 2014 - Quotes"]]

Here's a collection of quotes and quips from the deveopsdays in Gent. I've got
more material, but need to ingest more of it to get it to a coherent form.

Obviously, some of this might be old news to some of you, but actually those
were my first devopsdays, so bear with me. Of course, any errors from my note
taking and transcribing are my own.
