# Monitor modding

Something that always bugged me about my trusty [Acer
AL2423W](http://media.engadget.com/img/product/12/9ct/acer-al2423w-ja8-800.jpg)
monitor, was it's short stem and wide front legs. The shortness caused the
monitor to be very low compared to my head, suggesting a crouching position,
while the front legs always interfered with the keyboard. Today I was pondering
the possibilities to mount this instead on some kind of monitor arm to attach
to the desk. Those are quite expensive. Thinking about those, I was reminded
that all those monitors are mounted on standardised 100mm VESA mounts. Last
week a blackout fried one of my [Samsung SyncMaster
2443BWs](http://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/ProductImageCompressAll300/24-001-294-04.jpg).
Sad. But it has a nice little round footplate and an extensible (and swiveling)
mount. So I mounted the working Acer Monitor onto the better Samsung stand and
now have a properly mounted monitor that's not annoying anymore. I can even
tuck the old stand away into storage, should the need arise for some more
modding. Mission accomplished!
