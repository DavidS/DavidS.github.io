[[!meta title="Getting comfortable..."]]

Used a slow afternoon to get the next [example42](https://github.com/example42)
to [pass](https://github.com/example42/puppet-apt/pull/44) its tests again.
Also rebased my [sundry of
changes](https://github.com/DavidS/puppet-apt/commits/to-push) from last year
on top of the upstream development since then. I'll drip in the commits later
one by one to avoid a too confused git history.
