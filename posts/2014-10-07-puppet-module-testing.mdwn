[[!meta title="Puppet Module Testing"]]

Today I've invested a bit of time into getting modules back into shape. The
first was Alessandro's excellent
[puppet](https://github.com/example42/puppet-puppet) module. The
[PR](https://github.com/example42/puppet-puppet/pull/100) had six commits in
the end, fixing the various nits that travis complained about. Nothing fancy,
but annoying anyways. Now that this is green again, perhaps a little bit more
care with new contributions can be taken.

I've also added some other improvements I was sitting on for far too long:

  * [reports retention age](https://github.com/example42/puppet-puppet/pull/85)
  * [remove templatesdir setting](https://github.com/example42/puppet-puppet/pull/101)
