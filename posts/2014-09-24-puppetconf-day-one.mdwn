[[!meta title="PuppetConf 2014 - Day 1"]]

PuppetConf has started and the news are rolling in. A Summary.

  * [Puppet
    Server](http://puppetlabs.com/blog/puppet-server-bringing-soa-to-a-puppet-master-near-you):
    new clojure/jruby/jvm based puppet master to replace all ruby puppet
    masters. Seems to bring already decent perf improvements and the jvm is a
    much better runtime than MRI ever was. I for one welcome our new java
    overlords.
  * [Puppet Test
    Pilot](http://puppetlabs.com/community/puppet-test-pilots-program): PL
    invites the community for enhanced direct-to-dev feedback. I've subscribed.
  * "Puppet Approved": a term mentioned in [Puppet Lab's notes about day
    one](http://puppetlabs.com/blog/puppetconf-2014-day-1-tips-treats-and-tweets),
    which applies to modules that are regularily tested by PL and follow
    certain standards. More details can be found at the [puppet
    forge](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/approved).

The rest of stuff is already consisely wrapped up in the posts above, so I
won't duplicate that. I'll revisit this once the complete videos are rolling
in.
