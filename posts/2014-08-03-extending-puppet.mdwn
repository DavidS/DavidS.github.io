# [Extending Puppet](http://www.packtpub.com/extending-puppet/book)

[Disclaimer I: I received a free copy of the book for the promise of writing a review.]
[Disclaimer II: I'm mentioned twice in the book.]

A few weeks ago, [Alessandro](http://example42.com) asked me to publish a
review of his book "Extending Puppet". After a bit of waiting until the
publisher could provide me with access to the eBook, I could finally finish it
up this weekend.

"Extending Puppet" is a comprehensive overview of the modern
[puppet](http://puppetlabs.com) landscape. From explaining the basics of Puppet
syntax over discussing migration to Puppet to development of the enterprise
puppet infrastructure to deployment strategies to the tool ecosystem to
programming of the nuts and bolts of custom types and functions to the future
development of Puppet 4. While Alessandro surveys the breadth of the
possibilities, of course the most intricate technical details must be elided to
avoid overwhelming the reader with information that is better gathered from the
original reference manuals.

As is said in the foreword, the book is actually misnamed. "The Complete Puppet
Handbook" would be a much better fit. Personally I might even prefer it to be
called "The Hitchhiker's Guide to Puppet" and it should have a big "Do not
Panic!" decal on the back.

All in all I can recommend the book heartily both to the novice - as a starting
point to plan the usage of puppet - as well as to the hardened veteran - to
ascertain the professional toolbox is complete.
