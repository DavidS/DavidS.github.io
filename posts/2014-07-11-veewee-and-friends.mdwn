# veewee and friends

While writing a [CentOS 7](http://seven.centos.org/) template for
[veewee](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee):

    david@zion:~/Projects/veewee$ time rbenv exec bundle exec veewee vbox build 'test' --workdir=/home/david/Projects/veewee

It's fun how rubyists deny the need for (system) package management while
requiring two layers of sandboxes to execute a command without trashing the
rest of the system.

The install itself went surprisingly smooth: using the current CentOS 6.5
template, only the URLs and ISOs had to be changed. The final result is
currently [pending an upstream merge](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee/pull/963).
*Update:* merged.

The next step is
[pulling](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-vagrant-boxes/pull/42) that
template over to Puppet Lab's
[puppet-vagrant-boxes](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-vagrant-boxes) to
make the image publically available to those in need.

# puppet language evolution

While the vagrant boxes were test-building, I've also chipped in on the
[Resource Defaults
thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/puppet-dev/7sgPBwxOhfE) with a
rather lengthy post on actually implementing a safe evaluator and making the
puppet4 language radically flexible.
