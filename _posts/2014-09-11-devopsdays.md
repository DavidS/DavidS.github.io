# Conference Ahoi!

Finally, I've managed to sign up to a conference again. I'll be going to [DevOpsDays Ghent](http://devopsdays.org/events/2014-belgium/) on 27th and 28th of October. I'm already excited to see you all there!

I'll be flying in on Sunday evening from Vienna to Brussels and probably take the train to Ghent. [Contact me](mailto:david@black.co.at) if you want to link up somewhere along the way!
