After a [relaxing](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/cheesy42/15082954927/)
vacation in the
[mountains](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/cheesy42/15227104576/), I'm now
rearranging some ducks.

# puppet 3.7, foreman 1.6

The puppet upgrade itself went smoothly enough, as I was already on 3.6 before.
I'll need to work through the [massive list of
deprecations](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3.7/reference/release_notes.html#deprecations-in-preparation-for-puppet-40)
though.

The Foreman 1.6 upgrade was fine too, except for [some
minor](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foreman-dev/oC99OfjUcEI)
[nits](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/7582).
