A follow-up to [last week's docker-compose post](/posts/2019-04-27-docker-compose/).

# Updating the containers

Contrary to my assertion last week, `docker-compose up` happily restarts service containers:

```
~/owncloudserver # docker-compose up -d
Recreating owncloudserver_db_1    ... done
Recreating owncloudserver_redis_1 ... done
Recreating owncloudserver_owncloud_1 ... done
~/owncloudserver # git show
```

Because, of course, why wouldn't it?

# Protecting the network

[lskillen](https://nitech.slack.com/team/U94ASMRL7) from the [NI Tech Slack](https://nitech.slack.com) pointed out that I can also specify a IP address in the compose file:

```
diff --git a/docker-compose.yml b/docker-compose.yml
index ffbd51b..dd5d8a8 100644
--- a/docker-compose.yml
+++ b/docker-compose.yml

+      - "127.0.0.1:${HTTP_PORT}:8080"

```

Now the unencrypted backend port is not accessible from the outside anymore, and I didn't have to fiddle around with firewall rules.

```
~/owncloudserver # netstat -ant
