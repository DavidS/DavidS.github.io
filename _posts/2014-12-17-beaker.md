Tonight I'll be talking at the [Vienna System Architects
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Vienna-System-Architects-Meetup/) [December
Edition](http://www.meetup.com/Vienna-System-Architects-Meetup/events/218412622/)
about holistic systems testing with Beaker.

Here're the tools and repos I'll be talking about:

* [Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker): System Testing for puppet
* [serverspec](http://serverspec.org/resource_types.html): Testing Resources
  * [Tutorial](http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2014-serverspec-test-infrastructure.html): nice tutorial for serverspec
* [RSpec matchers](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/v/3-1/docs/built-in-matchers): the actual expectation DSL to use in the tests
* [Example code](https://github.com/DavidS/puppet-apache/tree/updated-specs): The puppet module I showed
* [ci-reporter](https://github.com/ci-reporter/ci_reporter): force rspec to output to JUnit XML reports for CI integration

* [puppetlabs/modulesync](https://github.com/puppetlabs/modulesync): a tool to push the glue files from ERB templates into many modules
