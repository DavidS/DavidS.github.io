Today, a change of pace: getting 52GB of image files synced with [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/) in a way that still provides for a nice editing/publishing workflow and keeps history for blogposts around.

# Goals

1. hands-off file synchronisation
1. keep history of posts and pages
1. automatic server-side jekyll rendering

# Results

1. Using the assistant through `git annex webapp` on linux and the dmg on MacOS allows hands off syncing of git commits of blogs posts and annexed image files
1. git retains all the history. With a `backup` remote in annex image data can also be archived
1. I likely can hook into the regular post-receive hooks on the server to launch processing, but need to be cognizant of the extra branches annex is maintaining for state.

I've now got a git-annex'd repo on my server, my workstation and my wife's workstation happily keeping 52GB of images (in 27k files) in sync.

# Insights

* 27k files in a repository make git-annex assistant slow to start up (it's rather annoying too to see only 10% of your SSD bandwidth and 12% CPU being used)
* stopping syncing in the git-annex web ui works to stop it from autocommitting and syncing half-finished work
* for big changes the CLI is **a lot** better than the assistant, as the CLI can batch and parallelise. The assistant would upload each file individually
* I would have saved a lot of time (and bandwidth) had I done the initial ingestion on the server instead of over the network
* my devolo 'dLAN 500 AVplus' loses connection due to overheating after hours of full load
* some weekends are less productive than others
* don't kill the assistant with ^C on the terminal
* People are seriously [running Windows 10 in KVM](https://heiko-sieger.info/running-windows-10-on-linux-using-kvm-with-vga-passthrough/) with their GPU on PCI pass-through for gaming.
